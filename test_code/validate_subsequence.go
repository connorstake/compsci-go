package test_code
// Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
// whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

// A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
// in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
// instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4]
// , and so do the numbers [2, 4]. Note that a single number in an array and the
// array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

// Sample Input
// array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
// sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

// Sample Output
// true

// FICTIONAL SCENARIO

Captain Lamport here. That was a close call! Thanks to you, we will have enough 
fuel to complete our mission. Your next mission is to help us safely land on Mars. 
To do this, we must deploy a series of probes on the planet's surface to map out 
the safest path for the spacecraft to land.The probes are equipped with cameras and 
sensors that capture images and data of the surrounding area. We need your help to 
develop a program that analyzes the data to determine the safest path. The program 
breaks down the images and data into smaller segments and will need an algorithm 
that determines if a particular segment is a subsequence of the entire image. 
This helps the program quickly determine if a particular segment is part of the 
safest path and provides a way for the spacecraft to navigate safely to the planet's 
surface. We are counting on you to help us land safely. Check back in when you're ready 
with that algorithm!
